Extended Placement - A simple (for end users) mod that adds a QoL feature that allows placing blocks around corners, making building bridges in midair, or building downwards, much more manageable
Just look past the edge of a block, into the air where you intend to build into, and the HUD will indicate with <> around the crosshair whether you can horizontally (or [] to vertically) extend from the block you're looking past.

Shout outs to (Quark)[https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark] for both the idea, and the general approach to the implementation of the raycast testing
