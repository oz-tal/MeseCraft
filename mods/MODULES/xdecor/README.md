X-Decor-libre is a libre Minetest mod which adds various decorative blocks
as well as simple gimmicks.

This is a libre version (free software, free media) of the X-Decor mod for Minetest.
It is the same as X-Decor, except with all the non-free files replaced and with
bugfixes. There are no new features.

## Special nodes

Most blocks in this mod are purely decorative, but there are also many special
blocks with special features:

The radio and speaker are purely decorative and have no special functionality.
